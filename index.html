         <h1>Orange Olive Oil Walnut Muffins</h1>
         <p>
            During the pandemic, like many others, I got into baking. 
            As the pandemic progressed, so did my baking. 
            I experimented ingredient replacements in a effort to make healthier and more broadly consumable--that is, accommodating and tasty--baked goods primarily in the form of muffins! 
            Below you will be able to browse through a modified-for-consumption (no pun intenteded) version of my orinigal notes for my first-ever original muffin recipe from which this resulted. 
            Enjoy!

               <h2>Recipe Inspiration and Inception</h2>
               <p>Used this recipe as a base that I’ve used multiple times as is and has been very popular:</p>

               <h2>Replacements and Adjustments</h2>
               <h3>Flour</h3>
                  <p>
                     Moving toward gluten-free flour (and then hopefully to “flourless” and just using maybe nuts and flax and starch or something),
                     So been experimenting with this gluten (and nut) free flour blend I got at Costco: <a href="https://www.costco.com/namaste-gluten-free-perfect-flour-blend%2c-6-pack.product.100242928.html">Namaste Gluten Free Perfect Flour Blend</a>  
                     It says to replace exactly and that’s what I’ve been doing</p>
               <h3>Sugar</h3>
                  <p>I’ve also been having the desire to sweeten with less refined sugar and would like to even go into sugar free baking like with dates and fruit and stuff, 
                     So I’ve been using maple syrup and honey instead 
                     I used raw local clover honey for this and changed the ratios of things based on this websites recommendations:
                  <a href="https://www.helloflavour.ca/en-ca/our-brands/billy-bee/sugar-to-honey-converter">Sugar to Honey Converter</a> 
                     So I replaced the white granulated sugar with 2.25 cups of honey in this recipe 
                  </p>   
               <h3>Olive Oil</h3>   
                  <p>
                     Based on the the sugar-to-honey-converter website's recommendation for using more than a cup of honey in a recipe, I also adjusted the olive oil by lowering the cup and a half of olive oil by reducing it by 1/2 a cup and a tablespoon so it amounted to 15tbsp which is one less than a cup.
                  </p>
               <h3>Orange Juice</h3>
                  <p>
                     I also adjusted the orange juice based on this same recommendation and adjusted down by the amount and to the same amount as the olive oil since the base recipe originally calls for 1/2 cups of each,
                     I used organic Valencia oranges and squeezed them in a hand squeezed and strained the juice through and fine mesh cone, 
                     It should also be noted that I used the zest of all of the oranges I squeezed to get the original 1.5cups of oj even though I didn’t end up using all of their juice in this altered recipe. 
                     I used the good portions (that were orange and not yellow and/or green/black) of the orange for the zest of 4 (they were large) organic Valencia oranges 
                  </p>
               <h3>Oven Temperature</h3>
                  <p>
                     I also adjusted the heat down 25 degrees as the honey website suggests which lead to me baking them at 325 degrees F instead of the 350,
                     I baked the muffins for 30min at first to see how they were doing, tested 2 larger ones with a fork and there was just a small amount that stuck to it (just barely like brownies), thought that it was sufficient and took them out
                  </p>
               <h3>Walnuts</h3>
                  <p>
                     I also chopped up some walnuts and mixed them into the batter before scooping it out into muffin tins that I hand glazed with the same olive oil,
                     I used the muffin tins instead of baking a cake so limit the portions
                  </p>
               <h2>Final Product</h2>

               <h2>Consistency and Taste Notes</h2>
               <p>
                  The batter was very think and yellow-nearly orange in color,
                  Slightly stuck to fork like brownies after 30 min of baking and took out,
                  Notice some of the larger ones were cracked at the top which I think is what I want,
                  The side of the muffin were very brown from the tin though not burnt,
                  I couldn’t taste much of the honey or flavor while eating after first taking out,
                  I like the soft bite of the walnuts (like pecans),
                  I thought the walnuts might be a bit bitter but they were actually fine especially,
                  When I had another muffin after it had partially cooled I tasted more of the honey and noticed how fragrant the muffins were and also how butter they were as well,
                  I think the muffins could do with less honey in taste as I thought they were a bit too sweet while I enjoyed them partially cooled which means I would have to readjust the olive oil and orange juice,
                  Trying them fresh out of the oven and partially cooled I take extra effort to notice if they’re gooey in the middle even partially cause the last batch of maple banana pecan muffins I made were still gooey on the inside and that wasn’t cool,
                  The texture of the muffin overall was bouncy and spongy and slightly firm as it held its shape which I think is due to the xanthum gum or whatever in the gf flour mix,
                  The tops of the muffins weren’t browned at all,
                  I think next time I could try cooking then in The silicone muffin thing so the sides aren’t as brown? Not sure if they hold more moisture or bake more slowly if I do that,
                  Looking forward to try them tomorrow at room temp and then a or two after that to see if the get more moist like how the cake would with the original recipe
